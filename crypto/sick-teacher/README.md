Based on my observation, there are letters and numbers in the ciphertext but the number was not changed. So, therefore, this is a Substitution Cipher.

I searched for Substitution Cipher Solver and found this website: https://www.guballa.de/substitution-solver

Here is the decoded ciphertext:

HISTORY OF HACKTHEBOX

HACKTHEBOX WENT LIVE SOME TIME IN MAY OF 2017. SINCE THEN, IT HAS GROWN VERY QUICKLY TO THOUSANDS OF MEMBERS FROM ALL OVER THE GLOBE.
THE HALL OF FAME LISTS THE TOP 100 USERS IN ORDER OF POINTS. AT THE TIME OF WRITING, THE TOP 3 USERS ARE STEFANO118, FILLIPOS AND AHMED.
THERE ARE SOME FORUMS, A SHOUTBOX AND A SLACK CHANNEL. SLACK AND SHOUTBOX ARE AWESOME, BUT THE FORUMS NEED SOME LOVE! I WISH MORE PEOPLE USED THEM.
HOPEFULLY THIS IS ENOUGH TEXT TO HELP WITH YOUR SUBSTITUTION! GET CRACKIN! PS DON'T FORGET TO SUPPORT HACKTHEBOX IF YOU CAN SPARE SOME MONEY. EVERY PENNY HELPS!
